## About STARS:

In this project, we tackle the challenges involved in the modernization of the satellite-based communications by considering the requirements and restrictions of the deployments of large-scale constellations of nano and small satellites. The contributions of the participant institutions are threefold: 

 Markup : 1. The application of state-of-the-art informatics for the operation and design of large scale satellite constellations.
          2. The definition and evaluation of hybrid architectures with LPWA and nano/small satellite technologies.
          3. The design of networking protocols for challenging and restricted networks in space communications.

Besides developing a strong international collaboration network around these topics, during the execution of this project we expect to provide student mobility and scientific training to the participants.
